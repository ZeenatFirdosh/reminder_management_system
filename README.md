I have developed a reminder management system website using PHP and MySQL. This web application allows users to efficiently manage their reminders and stay organized.

The reminder management system provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily create, edit, and delete reminders. The application utilizes PHP for the backend logic and MySQL as the database management system to store and retrieve reminder data.

Users can register an account on the website, which enables them to securely log in and access their personalized reminder dashboard. Once logged in, users can create new reminders by specifying the title, date, time, and any additional notes. The system also allows users to categorize reminders for better organization.

The website offers an intuitive user interface that displays reminders in a clear and organized manner.
The application incorporates robust security measures to protect user data. It includes features such as password hashing and encryption to safeguard sensitive information.

Overall, the reminder management system website I have created using PHP and MySQL offers users a convenient and efficient way to manage their reminders. Its user-friendly interface, flexible reminder creation, and organization options, along with notification features, contribute to a seamless reminder management experience.
